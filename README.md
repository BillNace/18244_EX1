# EX1: Introduction to Yosys

## Turning Stuff In
To submit this lab, follow these steps:

:one: Create a branch of the commit you want to submit, naming it as your final commit and push it to GitHub. Tag it as well.
```shell
git branch gradescope_final
git checkout gradescope_final
git add --all
git commit -m "My final submission. Yay, I'm done!"
git push -u origin gradescope_final
git tag -a final -m "Final submission for 18244 EX1"
git push --tags
```
:two: Log onto Gradescope and select the Lab 0 assignment.

:three: Submit via GitHub by linking your GitHub account. I’m assuming you have a GitHub account; if not, you should get one. You will only need to do this step once. Future projects will already have this linkage in place.

Please ensure the 18-244/644 class is selected, otherwise you won’t be able to select your repository. You may have to press "Request," and then you should see the checkmark next to the 18-244/644 organization.
